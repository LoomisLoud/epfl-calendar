We have some problems with the emulators, on some emulators the tests will cause a native crash and/or a segmentation fault, this is the emulator settings on which everything works : 

Emulator on which everything works well (important for tests mostly) :
	- Device : Nexus 5 (4.95", 1080x1920: xxhdpi)
	- Target : Android 4.4.2 - API Level 19 or Android 4.3.1 - API Level 18
	- CPU/ABI : Intel Atom (x86)
	- Keyboard : check "Hardware keyboard present"
	- Skin : WXGA 720
	- RAM : 2048
	- VM Heap : 64
	- Internal Storage : 200 MiB

In fact, it works on emulators with the Intel Atom CPU but does not work on emulators with CPU ARM... This concerns only the tests, the App runs well everywhere !

The command to build is :

ant -Demma.filter=\"-ch.epfl.calendar.thirdParty.*\" clean emma debug install test

The -Demma.filter is really important to remove the thirdparty package from the coverage metric.
